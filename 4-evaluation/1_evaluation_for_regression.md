* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It gives equal weight to all errors.
* Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE.
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides a measure of the average magnitude of errors in the same units as the target variable.
* R-squared (R2) Score: R2 measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better fit.
