* CRISP-DM (Cross-industry standard process for data mining):
   * Business Understanding
   * Data Understanding
   * Data Preparation
   * Modeling
   * Evaluation
   * Deployment

* From problem understanding to deployment
* ML Project:
  * Understand the problem
  * Collect the data
  * Train the model
  * Use it
 
* [**1-Business Understanding**]:
    * Our user complain about spam
    * Analyze to what extent it is a problem
    * Will ML help?
    * If not: propose an alternative solution
    *  Define the goal Use Case Spam Detection:
        * Reduce the amount of spam messages, or
        * Reduce the amount of complains about spam
        * The goal has to be measurable: reduce the amount of spam by 50%
 

* [**2-Data Understanding**]:
  * We have a report spam button
  * Is the data behind this button good enough?
  * Is it realiable?
  * Do we track it correctly?
  * Is the dataset large enough?
  * Do we need to get more data?
  * Iterative process


* [**3-Data Preparation**]
  * Clean the data
  * Build the pipelines (Workflow)
  * Convert into tabular form (dataframe)


* [**4-Modeling**]
  * Logistic regression
  * Decision tree
  * Neural network
  * etc
  * Iterative process
 
* [**5-Evaluation**]
  * Have we reached the goal?
  * How much?
  * Good enough?
 
* [**6-Deployment**]
  * Go back and adjust the goal
  * Stop working
  * Deploy

Kadang, berjalan bersamaan [**Evalution + Deployment**]:

-Online evaluation: feedback of user

-Iterative process

**ML project require many iterations**

* Start simple
* Learn from feedback
* Improve
